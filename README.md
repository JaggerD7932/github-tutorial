## Git vs. GitHub

Git is version control, like taking snapshots of code.  
Github is a cloud for git, which allows us to see these snapshots. It also has the added bonus of being a great way for people to collaborate with each other on their code as well.  

A good way to think of the two is like Git being a photographer who takes photos, where Github is like the album where you keep all the photos you've taken.

There are several IDEs to choose from, but there's only one Github.  
To make a Github account, you first need to navigate to Github and click the create an account icon.  
From there, follow the steps, making sure to use your HSTAT email username if you're from HSTAT.  
Once you're done there, you can get your SSH key set up.

> It's also great becuase you won't need to log in every time you want to access what you use SSH with, which makes getting into your IDE's code way easier.  

To start, you'll want to follow these steps:
1. Look at the top right corner, and click the profile icon, and navigate to settings.
2. On the left sidebar, click on SSH and GPG.
3. Add the title as "cloud9", assuming you're using Cloud9.

4.
